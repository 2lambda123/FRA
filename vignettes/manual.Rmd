abstract:
  R- package FRA is designed to performs fractional response analysi of single-cell responses as presented in the manuscript Nienałtowski et al. "Fractional response analysis reveals logarithmic cytokine responses in cellular populations" submitted (2020).
  # The package FRA is designed to estimate channel capacity between finite state input and multidimensional continuous output from experimental data. For efficient computations, it uses an iterative algorithm based on logistic regression. In addition, functions to estimate mutual information and calculate probabilities of correct discrimination between a pair of input values are implemented. The method is published in PLOS Computational Biology [@jetka2019].

# Preliminaries

## Requirements - Hardware
  + A 32 or 64 bit processor (recommended: 64bit)
  + 1GHz processor (recommended: multicore for a comprehensive analysis)
  + 2GB MB RAM (recommended: 4GB+, depends on the size of experimental data)

## Requirements - Software
The main software requirement is the installation of the R environment (version: >= 3.2), which can be downloaded from [R project website](https://www.r-project.org) and is distributed for all common operating systems.  We tested the package in  R environment installed on Windows 7, 10; Mac OS X 10.11 - 10.13 and Ubuntu 18.04 with no significant differences in the performance. The use of a dedicated Integrated development environment (IDE), e.g. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) is recommended. 

Apart from a base installation of R, SLEMI requires the following R packages:

1. for installation 

  + devtools
  
2. for estimation
  
  + nnet
  + doParallel (if parallel computation are needed)
  
3. for visualisation

  + ggplot2
  + ggthemes
  + grDevices
  + viridis
  
  
4. for data handling

  + data.table
  + reshape2
  + dplyr
  + foreach

Each of the above packages can be installed by executing 
  
> `install.packages("name_of_a_package")`

in the R console. 

Importantly, during installation availability of the above packages will be verified and missing packages will be automatically installed.

\newpage

## Installation

The package can be directly installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/sysbiosig/FRA).  For installation, open RStudio (or base R) and run following commands in the R console
```c
install.packages("devtools") # run if 'devtools' is not installed
library(devtools)
install_github("sysbiosig/FRA")
```
All packages that are required will be installed or updated automatically.

# Package functionalities

<!--  SLEMI package is designed to estimate information-theoretic measures between a discrete-valued input, $X$, and multivariate, continuous output, $Y$.  In a typical experiment aimed to quantify information flow a given signaling system, input values $x_1\leq x_2 \ldots... \leq x_m$, ranging from 0 to saturation are considered. -->

<!--  Then, for each input level, $x_i$,$n_i$ observations are collected, which are represetned as vectors  -->
<!--  $$y^i_j \sim P(Y|X = x_i)$$ -->
<!--  Within information theory the degree of information transmission is measured as the mutual information -->
<!--  $$MI(X,Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(x_i)\int_{R^k} P(y|X = x_i)log_2\frac{P(y|X = x_i)}{P(y)}dy$$ -->
<!--  where $P(y)$ is the marginal distribution of the output. MI is expressed in bits and $2^{MI}$ can be interpreted as the number of inputs that the system can resolve on average. -->

<!--  The maximization of mutual information with respect to the input distribution, $P(X)$,  defines the information capacity, $C^*$. Formally, -->
<!--  $$C^* = max_{P(X)} MI(X,Y)$$ -->
<!--  Information capacity is expressed in bits and $2^{C^*}$ can be interpreted as the maximal number of inputs that the system can effectively resolve. For details regarding information theory or its application in systems biology please see Methods section and Supplementary Information of the corresponding paper [@jetka2019]. -->

* Define FRA and confusion matrix

# Package structure

The FRA package provides their functionalities with three main functions:

1. `FRA()`-  fractional response analysis  performed for heterogeneous, multivariate, and dynamic measurements. Function computes: (i) the fractional response curve that quantifies fractions of cells that exhibit different responses to a change in dose, or any other experimental conditionand and (ii) the cell-to-cell heterogeneity, i.e., fraction of cells exposed to one dose that exhibits responses in the range characteristic for other doses.

2. `plotHeterogeneityPieCharts()` - visualises the cell-to-cell heterogeneity structure using table of pie charts. Each pie chart describes the fraction of cells exposed to one dose (rows)  that expibits responses typical for either of the doses (columns).

3. `plotFRC()`  visualises the fractional response curve (FRC) and the cell-to-cell heterogenity. FRC is represented as a line, whereas heterogeneity is represented as  colour band.

Morevoer, package contains examplary datasets, that were used in the publication:

1. `data.fra.cytof`

2. `data.fra.ps1`

3. `data.fra.ps3`

4. `data.fra.nfkb`


<!-- \newpage -->


# Input data

The function `FRA()` takes `data` in the form of the object `data.frame` with a specifc structure of rows and columns. 
Responses $y^i_j$ are assumed to be measured for a finite set of stimuli levels $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m$. The responses $y^i_j$ can be multidimensional. Usually, experimental dataset is represented as a table with rows and columns organized as shown in Figure 1.

```{r data_pdf3, fig.cap="Standard output graph presenting probabilities of correct discrimination between each pair of input values.", ,echo=FALSE, fig.pos="h",out.height="9cm"}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("table_data.pdf")
```

<!-- ```{r data_pdf, fig.cap="Conceptual representation of a generic experimental dataset needed for quantifying information transmission of a channel", ,echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h"} -->
<!-- # All defaults -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("table_data.pdf") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Data example 
An example of the input `data.frame`, which contains the multivariate dose-responses to IFN-a2a in **monocytes CD14+ CD16-** presented in the **MP** is available within the package under the variable `FRA::data.scrc.cytof`.  It has the following format

```{r init, include=FALSE}
library(FRA)
display_plots=TRUE
```

```{r nfkb2, results="asis",echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(FRA::data.itrc.cytof))
```

where each row represents measurements of a single-cell, the column named `Stim` specifies the dose level of IFN-a2a, while `pSTAT1`, `pSTAT3`, `pSTAT4`,`pSTAT5`,`pSTAT6`  are the normalized levels of phosporylated STATs in an individual cell. The above table can be shown in R by calling
```c
head(FRA::data.itrc.cytof)
```

# Fractional response analysis
Then, main function is called as:
```c
model <-  FRA::FRA(
  data = data,
  signal = "input",
  response = c("output_1", "output_2", "output_3", ...),
  bootstrap.number = bootstrap.number,
  ...
)
```
Variables `signal` and `response` describes respectively dose level and single-cell responses. These columns should be of type `numeric`; order and number of outputs should be the same for all cells. Number of observations in `data` shoulb large, possibly >100,  per input value is required.

The variable `bootstrap.number` represents number of bootstrap samples required for estimation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is crucial to choose this value carefully, as it induce estimator accuracy. 

The result of the function is an object of class `FRAModel`, that contains results of the estimator. To see the results call :
```c
print(model)
```
To get the FRA (cumulative frequency) and cell-to-cell heterogeneity (confusion matrix) please call `model$frc` and `model$heterogeneity`, respectively.

The result can be visualised using one of our plots, as it was presented in the publication.

FRA can be plotted using function:

```c
plotFRC(model)
```

The cell-to-cell heterogeneity can be plotted using function:
```c
plot(model)
```

## Example of usage 
Below, we present an application of `FRA` package to the case of the multivariate dose-responses to IFN-a2a in **monocytes CD14+ CD16-** described above. 
```c
library(FRA)
model <-
  FRA(
    data = FRA::data.itrc.cytof,
    signal = "Stim",
    response = c("pSTAT1", "pSTAT3", "pSTAT4", "pSTAT5", "pSTAT6"),
    bootstrap.number = 2)
```

```{r scrc_cytof_1, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE }
library(FRA)
model <-
  FRA(
    data = FRA::data.itrc.cytof,
    signal = "Stim",
    response = c("pSTAT1", "pSTAT3", "pSTAT4", "pSTAT5", "pSTAT6"),
    parallel_cores = 1,
    bootstrap.number = 2)
```
The result is called by:
```{r scrc_cytof_2, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE }
print(model)
```

```{r scrc_cytof_3, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE }
FRA::plotFRC(model = model) 
```

```{r scrc_cytof_4, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE }
FRA::plotHeterogeneityPieCharts(model = model)
```

# Details of SCRC packgae functions 
## Fractional response analysis
In order to perform fractional response analysis of single-cell data call 
```c
model <-FRA(
  data,
  signal = "signal",
  response = "response",
  sample = "sample",
  bootstrap.number = 0,
  bootstrap.sample_size = 1000,
  parallel_cores = 1,
  lr_maxit = 1000,
  MaxNWts = 5000,
  ...
)

``````

* `data` - a data.frame or data.table object in a wide format that describe response (might be multidimmensional) of the samples to the signal (now only one dimmensional); data.frame data consists columns of names defined by sample, signal (optional), and response; each row represents a response of one sample to the input signal; column signal define the input signal; columns response define the multidimmensional (optional) response to the input signal; column sample specify identifaction of sample; if sample is not defined then sample is identified by row number; 
* `signal` - character, specify name of the column that represents the input signal; 	
* `response` vector of characters, that specify names of the columns that represents the output response;
* `sample`	- character (optional), specify name of the column that consists identifiaction of sample;
* `parallel_cores` - specify number of cores used for computations, `default = 1`
* `bootstrap.number` (`default = 1`) - numeric, `bootstrap.number >= 1`, specify nymber of bootstrap samples used for estimation SCRC and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is crucial to choose this value carefully, as it induce estimator accuracy. The proper value depends on data dimmensions and density distribution. The practice indicates that the higher number of bootstrap samples are required to obtain satisfying level of the accuracy of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity estimator. The `bootstrap.number = 1` denotes that one bootstrap sampling is performed to guarantee equipotence between number of cells for each dose, that is assumed in method;
*  `bootstrap.sample_size` - numeric, size of the bootstrap sample;
* `lr_maxit` (`default = 1000`) - a maximum number of iterations of fitting step of logistic regression algorithm in `nnet` function. If a warning regarding lack of convergence of logistic model occurs, should be set to a larger value (possible if data is more complex or of a very high dimension); 
* `MaxNWts` (`default = 5000`) - a maximum number of parameters in logistic regression model. A limit is set to prevent accidental over-loading the memory. It should be set to a larger value in case of exceptionally high dimension of the output data or very high number of input values. In principle, logistic model requires fitting $(m-1)\cdot(d+1)$ parameters, where $m$ is the number of unique input values and $d$ is the dimension of the output.

The function returns the `FRAModel` object that contains among others
* `frc` - a `data.frame` that describe fractional response curve; contains two columns `dose` and `frc`
* `heterogeneity` - a `data.frame` that describes cell-to-cell heterogeneity, i.e., fraction of cells exposed to one dose (rows) that exhibits responses in the range characteristic for other doses (columns).

## plotFRC
In order to visualise fractional response curve call 
```c
    model,
    title_ =
      "Fractional Response Curve",
    xlab_ = "Dose",
    ylab_ = "Cumulative fraction of cells",
    fill.guide_ = "legend",
    ylimits_ = TRUE,
    alpha_ = 0.5,
    theme.signal = NULL,
    plot.heterogeneity = TRUE,
    ...
```
* `model` - FRAModel object return by FRA function
* `title_` - character, specify title of plot, default "Fractional Response Curve"
* `xlab_`	- character, label of x axes, default "Dose"
* `ylab_`	 - character, label of y axes and legend title, default "Cumulative fraction of cells"
* `fill.guide_`	- argument specify if legend should be displayed; legend is displayed for `fill.guide_ = "legend"`,  legend is  not displayed for `fill.guide_ = NULL `,  `default = "legend"`
* `ylimits_`	 - logical (TRUE  or FALSE) or numeric vector of minimum and maximum of y axes,
* `theme.signal`	- optional, object returned by GetRescaledSignalTheme
*  `plot.heterogeneity` - logical, define if  FRC visualise the heterogeneity structure, `default = TRUE`

## plotHeterogeneityPieCharts
In order to visualise th cell-to-cell heterogeneity structure, call
```c
plotHeterogeneityPieCharts(
  model,
  max.signal = NULL,
  title_ = "Cell-to-cel heterogeneity",
  ylab_ = "dose",
  xlab_ = "dose for which response is typical",
  ...
)
```

* `model`	- FRAModel object return by FRA function
* `max.signal` - maximal signal for which the cell-to-cell heterogeneity is plotted, `default  = max(signal)`
*`title_`	- character, specify title of plot, `default = "Cell-to-cel heterogeneity"`
* `ylab_` - character, label of y axes, `default = "dose"`
* `xlab_`	- character, label of x axes, `default = "dose for which response is typical"`


<!-- ## Calculation of the mutual information  -->

<!-- The function `mi_logreg_main()` takes a similar list of arguments and generates analogous plots to the function `capacity_logreg_main()`. The differences are listed below. -->

<!-- Firstly, user must specify the distribution of input that should be used for calculation of the mutual information. It is done  by passing a numeric vector via the argument `pinput` of `mi_logreg_main()` function. Secondly, the returned list stores the value of the computed mutual information (in bits) under the element `mi`. -->

<!-- ## Calculation of the probabilities of correct discrimination -->

<!-- Calculation of the probabilities of correct discrimination between pairs of input values is performed by running the following command -->

<!-- ```c -->
<!-- prob_discr_pairwise(dataRaw, signal, response, output_path) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- where the required arguments are analogous to the arguments of the functions `capacity_logreg_main()` and `mi_logreg_main()`.  -->
<!-- The probabilities of correct discrimination are computed for each pair of unique input values and returned as a list with the following elements -->

<!-- * prob_matr - a symmetric numeric matrix with a probability of discriminating between $i$-th and $j$-th input values in cell (i,j)  -->
<!-- * diagnostics - a list of summaries describing fitted logistic regression models of classification  between each pair of input values. -->

<!-- In addition, a plot of corresponding pie charts is created in `output_path` in the pdf format. -->



<!-- \newpage -->

<!-- # Diagnostic procedures -->

<!-- In addition to the sole calculation of the information capacity, the function `capacity_logreg_main()` can also be used to asses accuracy of the channel capacity estimates -->
<!-- resulting from potentially insuffecient sample size and potential over-fitting of the regression model. Two test are implemented. Precisely, the function can perfom -->

<!-- 1. Bootstrap test - capacity is re-calculated using $\alpha$% of data, sampled from the original dataset without replacement. After repeating the procedure $n$ times, standard deviation of the obtained sample can serve as an error of the capacity estimate. -->
<!-- 2. Over-fitting test - the original data is divided into Training and Testing datasets. Then, logistic regression is estimated using $\alpha$% of data (training dataset), and integrals of channel capacity are calculated via Monte Carlo using remaining $(1-\alpha)$% of data (testing dataset). It is repeated $n$ times. -->

<!-- In order to perform diagostic tests, that by default are turned off,  user must set the value of the input argument    -->

<!-- * testing = TRUE (default=FALSE)  -->

<!-- In addition, settings of the diagnostic test can be altered by changing the following paramaters -->

<!-- * TestingSeed (default= 1234) - the seed for the random number generator used to sample original dataset, -->
<!-- * testing_cores (default= 4) - a number of cores to use (via `doParallel` package) in parallel computing,  -->
<!-- * boot_num (default= 40) - a number of repetitions of the bootstrap ,  -->
<!-- * boot_prob (default= 0.8) - a fraction of initial observations to  use in the bootstrap,  -->
<!-- * traintest_num (default= 40) - a number of repetitions of the overfitting test, -->
<!-- * partition_trainfrac (default= 0.6) - a fraction of initial observations to use as a training dataset in the overfitting test -->


<!-- # Additional functionalities of the function `capacity_logreg_main()` -->
<!-- In addition, to the basic functionalities described above, the function `capacity_logreg_main()` allows to control several other paramters of the alorithm that computes the information capacity. These parameters and their effects are listed below.  -->


<!-- * `model_out` (`default=TRUE`) - logical, specify if `nnet` model object should be saved into output file -->
<!-- * `plot_width` (`default = 6`) - numeric, the basic width of created plots  -->
<!-- * `plot_height` (`default = 4`) - numeric, the basic height of created plots -->
<!-- * `scale` (`default = TRUE`) - logical, value indicating if the columns of `dataRaw` are to be centered and scaled, what is usually recommended for the purpose of stability of numerical computations. From a purely theoretical perspective, such transformation does not influence the value of channel capacity. -->
<!-- * `lr_maxit` (`default = 1000`) - a maximum number of iterations of fitting step of logistic regression algorithm in `nnet` function. If a warning regarding lack of convergence of logistic model occurs, should be set to a larger value (possible if data is more complex or of a very high dimension). -->
<!-- * `MaxNWts` (`default = 5000`) - a maximum number of parameters in logistic regression model. A limit is set to prevent accidental over-loading the memory. It should be set to a larger value in case of exceptionally high dimension of the output data or very high number of input values. In principle, logistic model requires fitting $(m-1)\cdot(d+1)$ parameters, where $m$ is the number of unique input values and $d$ is the dimension of the output. -->

<!-- The latter two parameters, i.e `lr_maxit` and `MaxNWts`, allow to change the parameters of the logistic regression model fitting within the dependent `nnet` package.  -->


<!-- \clearpage -->

<!-- # Examples -->

<!-- ## Minimal example -->
<!-- Below, we present a minimal model that may serve as a quick introduction to computations within the package. Precisely, we consider a system  -->

<!-- i)  with four different input values $X$: 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 -->
<!-- ii) with the conditional output, $Y|X=x$, give by a one-dimensional log-normal distribution $\exp\{\mathcal{N}(10\cdot\frac{x}{1+x},1)\}$ -->
<!-- iii) and the sample consisting of 1000 observations for each input value. -->

<!-- The example is analogous to the Test scenario 2 of the **Supplementary Information** of [@jetka2019] (Section 3.2). -->

<!-- **Input data** -->

<!-- Firstly, we generate a a synthetic dataset. The data corresponding to the model can be generated, and represented as the data frame `tempdata` with columns `input` and `output`, by running -->

<!-- ```{r mwe1,include=FALSE} -->
<!-- xs=c(0,0.1,1,10) # concentration of input. -->
<!-- tempdata = data.frame(input = factor(c(t(replicate(1000,xs))), -->

<!--                       output =  c(matrix(rnorm(4000, mean=10*(xs/(1+xs)),sd=c(1,1,1,1)), -->
<!--                                             ncol=4,byrow=TRUE) )) -->
<!-- tempoutput  <- capacity_logreg_main(dataRaw=tempdata,  -->
<!--                                     signal="input", response="output") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```c -->
<!-- xs=c(0,0.1,1,10) # concentration of input. -->
<!-- tempdata = data.frame(input = factor(c(t(replicate(1000,xs))), -->
<!--                       levels=xs), -->

<!--                                             ncol=4,byrow=TRUE) )) -->

<!-- knitr::kable(rbind(tempdata[1:2,],tempdata[2001:2002,],tail(tempdata,2))) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Calculation of the information capacity** -->

<!-- The Information capacit can be calculated using the  `capacity_logreg_main()` function that takes the data frame "tempdata"  as `dataRaw` argument. Column names "input" and "output" are used as arguments `signal` and `response`, respectively. The `output_path` is set as "minimal_example/". Therefore, the function is run as follows -->

<!-- ```c                    -->
<!-- tempoutput  <- capacity_logreg_main(dataRaw=tempdata,  -->
<!--                                     signal="input", response="output",  -->
<!--                                     output_path="minimal_example/") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Results of the computations are returned as a data structure described before. In addition, results are  presented in the form of the following graph (by default saved as MainPlot.pdf in `minimal_example/` directory). It represents the input-output data and gives the corresponding channel capacity.  -->

<!-- ```{r data_pdf2, fig.cap="Standard output graph of the minimal working example", echo=FALSE, fig.pos="h"} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("plot_1.pdf") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- *Structure of the package* -->
<!-- **The function `SCRC()`** triggers -->

<!-- i) preprocessing of the data () -->

<!-- ii) calculation of  the SCRC, i.e., fractions of cells that exhibit different response levels as the dose increases as well as the cell-to-cell heterogeneity structure  -->

<!-- iii) calulcation of the confusion matrix -->

<!-- iv) calculation of the bands representing the cell-to-cell heterogeneity structure in SCRC plot -->


<!-- The algorithm to compute the information capacity is implemented within the function \newline `capacity_logreg_algorithm()`, which uses logistic regression from the `nnet` package. -->

<!-- Diagnostic procedures (significance and uncertainties of estimates) are provided in an internal function `capacity_logreg_testing()`. These are based on data bootstrapping and overfitting test. -->

<!-- For visualization, a set of graphs is created by an internal function `capacity_output_graphs()` and saved in a specified directory. In addition, `capacity_logreg_main()` returns a list with capacity estimates, optimal input probability distribution, diagnostic measures and other summary information about the analysis. -->


<!-- **The function `mi_logreg_main()`** serves to calculate the mutual information. It initiates similar steps as the function `capacity_logreg_main()` but without performing the optimization of the distribution of the input. Instead, it requires the input distribution to be specified by the user as a function's argument. -->

<!-- Logistic regression and Monte Carlo methods, following an analogous algorithm as within the `capacity_logreg_algorithm()` function, are combined to estimate mutual information within a function `mi_logreg_algorithm()`. Visualisation and diagnostics are carried out by the same set of auxillary functions as for channel capacity (internal functions `capacity_output_graphs()` and `capacity_logreg_testing()`). -->


<!-- **The `prob_discr_pairwise()`** allows to estimate probabilities of correct discrimination between two different values of the input. It implements estimation of probabilities of correct classification by logistic regression (from `nnet` package) for each pair of input values. The probabilities of correct discrimination are visualized with a graph composed of pie charts. -->

<!-- **Diagnostics** -->

<!-- The diagnostic test can be performed as follows -->

<!-- ```c -->
<!-- dir.create("example1_testing/") -->
<!-- outputCLR=capacity_logreg_main(dataRaw=data_example1, -->
<!--                             signal="signal",response="response", -->

<!--                             boot_num = 40, boot_prob = 0.8,  -->
<!--                             traintest_num = 40,partition_trainfrac = 0.6) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- It will run diagnostics with 40 re-sampling of the data, where bootstrap is calculated using 80% of the data, while the over-fitting test uses 60% of the original dataset.  -->

<!-- ```{r data_pdf4, fig.cap="Standard output graph of the diagnostic procedures. P-values (PV) are based on empirical test either left- or right- sided.

<!-- # All defaults -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("plot_3.pdf") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The top diagram shows the value of the capacity estimate (in black) obtained from the complete dataset and the mean value of bootstrap repetitions with indicated +/- standard deviation (in red). Plots that follow show histograms of calculated capacities for different diagnostic regimes. The black dot represents the estimate of the channel capacity based on the complete dataset. In addition, corresponding empirical p-values of both tests (left- and right-sided) are calculated to assess the randomness of obtained results (PV in the plots). -->

<!-- A reliable estimation of the information capacity should yield the following results of the bootstrap and overfitting tests. -->

<!-- 1.  The bootstrap test should yield distribution of the capacity estimates with small variance. In addition, the capacity estimated based on the complete dataset should not be an outlier (p-value>0.05). Otherwise, it would indicate that the sample size is too low for an accurate estimation of the channel capacity. -->

<!-- 2. The over-fitting test should provide similar results. The capacity estimate obtained based on the complete dataset should lie within the distribution of capacities generated in the test. In the opposite case, it could mean that the logistic regression model does not fully grasp the essential aspects of input-output dependencies in the data.  -->
